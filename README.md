# Haskell project for batch-43
This project is simulating a controller for an electronic vehicle with trusters.

- Controls are shown on screen
- Battery level drops over time and slow down as power is reduced
- Power output to truster is limited as battery level drops below set points
- Joystick Y axis controls power to truster
- Joystick X asix control truster direction

A config set some limits and controls for the run-time environment
